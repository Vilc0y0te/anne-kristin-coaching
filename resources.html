          <p class="portrait-hero__lead">As part of my archetypal coaching work, I create <em>digital portraits</em> for clients in which they are represented through their archetype. The portrait serves as a visual anchor, an invitation to recognise, embody, and consciously step into an inner pattern that is already present.</p>
          <p>Each portrait captures the energies you are learning to recognise and work with. It is both a mirror and a compass, showing you who you already are beneath the roles you play.</p>

          <h4 class="feed-article__title">When "Nice" Coaching Stops Working</h4>
          <p class="feed-article__subtitle">A 4-Stage Archetypal Model for Coaches</p>
          <div class="feed-article__body">
            <p>Not every coachee benefits from the same coaching style. Applying one approach to everyone may feel ethical, but in practice it can be limiting.</p>
            <p>Historically, kings surrounded themselves with advisors. Yet the most powerful figure at court was often the <strong>Fool or Trickster</strong>: <em>the only one permitted to challenge the king's ego and expose blind spots that polite counsel could not reach.</em></p>
            <p>Four broad developmental levels, each requiring a different coaching stance:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Stage 1: Initiates</strong> are still forming their identity and need safety, reflection, and containment.</li>
              <li><strong>Stage 2: Journeymen</strong> are building competence and confidence and benefit from guidance and clear feedback.</li>
              <li><strong>Stage 3: Rulers</strong> have a formed ego and consolidated power. Here, gentle enquiry alone can become collusive; honest, constructive disruption is sometimes necessary.</li>
              <li><strong>Stage 4: Stewards</strong> have integrated power with responsibility and seek meaning, legacy, and ethical depth.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A powerful coach adapts to ego formation: containment for initiates, guidance for journeymen, disruption for rulers, and witnessing for stewards.</p>

          <h4 class="feed-article__title">Finding Your "Mind Igniter"</h4>
          <p class="feed-article__subtitle">Why every creative mind reaches its true brilliance only in the right presence</p>
          <div class="feed-article__body">
            <p>You know you're brilliant. You feel the pressure of something inside you, a creative force that wants out, yet it hasn't found its form. Not because you lack talent or discipline, but because you may be missing something essential: <strong>a mind igniter.</strong></p>
            <p>A mind igniter is the person whose presence awakens a dimension of thought you cannot access alone. Think Jobs &amp; Wozniak, Lewis &amp; Tolkien, Da Vinci &amp; Verrocchio, Goethe &amp; Schiller: pairs of minds that became exponentially greater together.</p>
            <p>How you recognise that mind which complements yours:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>They don't sharpen your thoughts; they ignite them.</li>
              <li>Ideas bounce between you like fast tennis balls.</li>
              <li>Conversations explode with insight you didn't know you had.</li>
              <li>There's friction, but it expands you, never drains you.</li>
              <li>Accountability happens naturally. You rise together.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This isn't mentorship. It's a creative alliance. Until you meet the mind that ignites yours, your brilliance stays only half-unlocked. You're not blocked. You're waiting for resonance.</p>

          <h4 class="feed-article__title">Epigenetics &amp; Boundaries</h4>
          <p class="feed-article__subtitle">Why you freeze when you know exactly what to say</p>
          <div class="feed-article__body">
            <p>Have you ever wondered why you know exactly what you should say, yet you hesitate, soften, or stay silent?</p>
            <p>Your <strong>mind</strong> may be in 2025, but your <strong>nervous system</strong> might still be in 1988, and your <strong>family imprint</strong> could be from 1950.</p>
            <p>Epigenetics shows that the emotional patterns of previous generations don't disappear. They're passed down as stress blueprints. If your mother or grandmother lived under criticism, dominance, or volatile approval, their nervous systems adapted for survival. And those adaptations can be inherited.</p>
            <p>So when someone crosses your boundary today, you're not just reacting to the moment. You're reacting with your own childhood conditioning, your mother's stress responses, and your grandmother's survival strategies, all firing in milliseconds, long before the logical mind arrives.</p>
            <p>The good news? Epigenetic patterns aren't destiny. They're modifiable. Each time you pause, breathe, and respond with calm clarity, you are rewriting the script and creating a new template for yourself and the next generation.</p>
            <p><strong>Boundaries are not just psychological or relational. They are biological evolution in real time.</strong></p>

          <div class="feed-article__body">
            <p>Since ancient times, humans have wrestled with the same inner fears we face today: fear of failure, self-doubt, lack of confidence. One of art's quiet powers is that it allows us to feel into these timeless anxieties, without explanation, without instruction, and in doing so, find the strength to move forward.</p>
            <p>Michelangelo was in his early twenties when he was commissioned to create David, and he made a radical choice. He did not depict David during the battle with the giant Goliath, nor after it, but <em>in the moment before it begins.</em></p>
            <p>David stands tense and alert, inwardly focused, sling and stone ready. There is no heroic bravado. The furrowed brow and fixed gaze reveal a young man fully aware of the overwhelming power he is about to face. It is the face of courage that includes fear rather than denying it.</p>
            <p><strong>Greatness is not measured by wins, but by the willingness to face what stands before us.</strong></p>

          <div class="feed-article__body">
            <p>Those inexplicable, mysterious images that defy reality. Grotesques are hybrid creatures from Renaissance art that challenge our perception and force us to confront the boundaries between the familiar and the strange.</p>
            <p>We are irrevocably forced to engage with what we see. These images act as a mirror held up to the subconscious, revealing the tensions between order and chaos, beauty and distortion, the known and the unknown.</p>

          <div class="feed-article__body">
            <p>Have you ever truly thought about why we are so apprehensive about ageing?</p>
            <p>The Maiden &middot; Mother &middot; Crone workshop is a space to reflect on how these three archetypal energies live within us throughout life. We explored what it means to <strong>age not as a loss, but as a deepening, a continuous becoming.</strong></p>
            <p>One participant shared afterward: <em>"The main message to me was to embrace and accept even the part of me who rejects the idea of ageing."</em></p>
            <p>When women come together to rewrite their stories, we dissolve the myths that keep us small. We remember our wholeness: the Maiden's curiosity, the Mother's strength, and the Crone's wisdom, all within us.</p>

          <p class="feed-article__subtitle">Some things seem impossible until someone proves it can be done</p>
          <div class="feed-article__body">
            <p>No industry is as brutally competitive as the world of supermodels. Youth and genetic perfection are treated as currency. Beauty expires fast. Careers, even faster. And yet, <strong>Carmen Dell'Orefice</strong> quietly defies all that. At 94 years old, she still graces magazine covers and walks runways.</p>
            <p>Her secret? She owns her story. She doesn't sell clothes; she sells possibility. She embraced time as her ally, her silver hair and serenity becoming her signature. She transcends competition. And she embodies the <strong>Crone archetype</strong>: not decline, but arrival. Wisdom crowned with grace.</p>
            <p>She proves that elegance, relevance, and impact are not bound by age. They arise from self-respect, authenticity, and courage. She has a story. She is symbol.</p>

          <h4 class="feed-article__title">Is Death a Deadline?</h4>
          <p class="feed-article__subtitle">Making old age an adventure by living into the future</p>
          <div class="feed-article__body">
            <p>86-year-old Senda chose me as her coach to prepare for the end of her life. Struggling with poor health, loneliness, and limited mobility, she felt that her life had lost meaning.</p>
            <p>Instead of focusing on preparing for death, I asked: <em>Is death a deadline?</em> What if we could focus on creating a legacy that endures? I asked Senda, "What would you like to be remembered for?" From this, the idea of a <strong>Time Capsule</strong> was born: a collection of her life's essence, favourite photos, recipes, stories, and reflections for future generations.</p>
            <p>The shift from preparing for death to creating something for the future brightened Senda. She regained a sense of agency. Living into the future, through imagination, reflection, and legacy-building, turns ageing into an adventure.</p>

          <h4 class="feed-article__title">The Human Core in the Age of AI</h4>
          <p class="feed-article__subtitle">Why strengthening the inner self matters more than ever</p>
          <div class="feed-article__body">
            <p>AI isn't a sentient agent with intentions. Like any tool, its impact depends on the human using it and the emotional state they're in. <em>The issue isn't the tool. It's the unresolved pain beneath the surface.</em></p>
            <p>Instead of outsourcing responsibility to technology, the deeper work is: strengthen the inner self. Nurture emotional resilience. Sharpen independent thinking and the ability to discern truth from noise. Build communities where people feel safe, seen, and supported.</p>
            <p><strong>When we feel grounded and connected, tools amplify our creativity, not our suffering.</strong> The goal shouldn't be to censor innovation, but to become worthy users of the tools we build.</p>

          <h4 class="feed-article__title">Signal vs Noise: The Monk's Way</h4>
          <p class="feed-article__subtitle">Building your inner sanctum in a world of distractions</p>
          <div class="feed-article__body">
            <p>In the old monasteries, life followed a sacred rhythm. Monks lived with discipline and deliberate limitation, not as deprivation but as devotion: a way to protect their <strong>inner sanctum</strong> and stay aligned with their mission.</p>
            <p>Modern life is the opposite: too many paths, too many choices, too many voices. Monastic clarity came from one simple question: <em>Does this serve the mission?</em> Everything else was silence.</p>
            <p>How to build your inner sanctum: start each morning asking "What is the one thing I want to create today?" Silence the random bells. Follow an inner rhythm of focused work blocks and moments of silence. Simplify. Seek ground truth.</p>
            <p><strong>Structure becomes liberation. Discipline becomes clarity. Order calms inner chaos.</strong></p>

          <div class="feed-article__body">
            <p>Every day, I open my inbox or LinkedIn and get pulled in ten different directions. Many are good. Some are even great. But too much of a good thing is still noise, and noise blurs your vision.</p>
            <p>Three daily habits: <strong>Start with yourself, not the world.</strong> Ask: "What do I want to build or create today?" <strong>Align with your mission.</strong> Use it as your filter. <strong>Limit input to protect output.</strong> Set boundaries to protect your attention.</p>
            <p>Your power lies not in chasing the noise, but in <strong>building with clarity, focus, and intention.</strong></p>
