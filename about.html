          <h2>From the corporate script to authoring my own story</h2>
          <p>Like many, I grew up with dreams. But I was encouraged to leave them behind and focus on the "real world." I followed the societal script, building a successful corporate career in advertising, cultural management, and luxury retail. From the outside, everything looked great — but on the inside, I felt disconnected from my true self.</p>
          <p>After hitting rock bottom, I realized my life wasn't aligned with who I truly am or what I wanted to contribute to the world. I left my job to pursue my passion for art — a dream I had buried for too long. I moved to Italy to study children's book illustration at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Macerata.</p>
          <p>While I loved my new path, the journey taught me something essential: success isn't one-size-fits-all. Each person must find their own path, and that journey begins with a shift in mindset and a curated vision for the future.</p>
          <p>In 2020, I became a certified coach and turned everything I had learned — through art, through Jungian psychology, through my own transformation — into a practice that helps others break free from societal expectations and become the authors of their own stories.</p>

        <h2>Shifting perspectives, opening doors</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 640px; margin: 0 auto;">I help people navigate change by shifting their perspective and reframing how they see the world — guiding them to uncover hidden opportunities and possibilities that once seemed invisible.</p>

          <h3>Stories &amp; Archetypes</h3>
          <p>Using the wisdom of ancient myths and the archetypal blueprint of human experience, I bring clarity to how we relate to ourselves and the world around us.</p>

          <div class="method__step-number" style="font-size: var(--font-size-md);">&#9673;</div>
          <h3>Self-Awareness &amp; Perception</h3>
          <p>By amplifying self-awareness and sharpening perception, I help individuals tap into their unique superpowers and transform their lives from the inside out.</p>
